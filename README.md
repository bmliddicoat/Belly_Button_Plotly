## Objective 
The client has asked for the creation of a horizontal bar chart, bubble chart, gauge chart and customization of the dashboard.  The bar chart will display the top ten bacterial species (OTUs) of an individualâ€™s id.  This will be selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.   The bubble chart will help display bacteria cultures of a sample.  The x-axis will be the bacteria id (OTU ids) and y-axis of the sample values of the bacteria.  The bubbles will represent the otu ids through marker color.  The size of bubble will increase with increase of sample value.  A hover-text will display otu labels.  The last chart is the gauge chart.  It will display the weekly washing frequency.  It will be a measure of 0-10.  Lastly, the customization of the dashboard will strengthen the appearance of the website and add more context for a viewer.  Apllications used include JavaScript, HTML, Plotly, and CSS.
